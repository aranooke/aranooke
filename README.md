# Hi, I'm Artem ðŸ‘‹
I am a junior software engineer with one year of experience, specializing in writing modern telegram bots and web applications based on frameworks such as Django, Flask, and Node.js. 
While my professional journey is relatively young, I bring a strong foundation in backend development with Django.


Throughout my career, I have gained valuable insights working with diverse architectural paradigms, including monolithic, microservices, and serverless architectures. I have successfully leveraged this knowledge to design and develop scalable and efficient solutions. Moreover, I actively engage in open-source projects, contributing to the developer community and staying connected with the latest industry advancements.

In recent times, my focus has shifted towards building innovative telegram bots and web applications, employing a modern approach. With frameworks like Django, Flask, and Node.js, I am able to create dynamic and interactive applications that meet the needs of today's users. I embrace the latest technologies and industry best practices, ensuring that my solutions are robust, secure, and maintainable.

As a junior software engineer, I am constantly learning and expanding my skill set. I have a deep passion for continuous improvement and actively seek out new challenges to enhance my abilities. By combining my solid foundation in backend development with my expertise in developing telegram bots and web applications using modern frameworks, I am well-equipped to contribute to the success of any project.
